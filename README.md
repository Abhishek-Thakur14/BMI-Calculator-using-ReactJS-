How It Works

    The user enters their height in centimeters and weight in kilograms.
    On clicking the calculate button, the app dynamically computes the BMI using the formula:
    BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m))
    The result is displayed with a brief message indicating the BMI category.
